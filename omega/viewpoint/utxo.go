// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The unspent transaction output (utxo) set consists of an entry for each
// unspent output using a format that is optimized to reduce space using domain
// specific compression algorithms.  This format is a slightly modified version
// of the format used in Bitcoin Core.
//
// Each entry is keyed by an outpoint as specified below.  It is important to
// note that the key encoding uses a VLQ, which employs an MSB encoding so
// iteration of utxos when doing byte-wise comparisons will produce them in
// order.
//
// The serialized key format is:
//   <hash><output index>
//
//   Field                Type             Size
//   hash                 chainhash.Hash   chainhash.HashSize
//   output index         VLQ              variable
//
// The serialized value format is:
//
//   <header code><compressed txout>
//
//   Field                Type     Size
//   header code          VLQ      variable
//   compressed txout
//     compressed amount  VLQ      variable
//     compressed script  []byte   variable
//
// The serialized header code format is:
//   bit 0 - containing transaction is a coinbase
//   bits 1-x - height of the block that contains the unspent txout
//
// Example 1:
// From tx in main blockchain:
// Blk 1, 0e3e2357e806b6cdb1f70b54c3a3a17b6714ee1f0e68bebb44a74b1efd512098:0
